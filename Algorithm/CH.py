# Author: Will Pascuzzi
# The "construction heuristic" for the scheduling process is a greedy algorithm that
# seeks to place each element in its most optimal position as it iterates through them
# It will not go backwards and change elements that have been placed, and it does not try to guarantee 
# an optimal final score. This allows it to run quickly and place each element in a position
# to find a hopefully very good local optimum
